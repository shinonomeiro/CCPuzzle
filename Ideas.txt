General gameplay
- Player is given an initial play block at start
- Player can swap its play block with a grid block by tapping on it
- Grid scan bar moves from top to bottom of playable range
- When scan bar hovers a row, perform matches on the blocks of that row in both directions
- While matches are being processed, stop scan bar progression
- While matches are being processed, player can keep playing
- Execute additional passes until no more matches can be found, then resume scan bar
- [Tentative] Highlight to-be-matched blocks when some are found
- Combo counter for successive matches (regardless of block count)
	e.g. 3 horizontal, then 4 vertical = 1 combo
- Block counter for total number of blocks matched in chain
	e.g. 3 horizontal + 4 vertical = 7 blocks
- HP bar is located above the grid on the UI along with character (use ccui LoadingBar)

Block types
- Color blocks: these are the most common, matchable, swappable
- Glass blocks: see below, less common, not matchable, not swappable
- Item blocks: see below, not matchable, not swappable

Glass blocks
- Get tinted with the color of adjacent matches
- Can be destroyed by nearby bombs

Item blocks
- Item blocks cannot be swapped but rather execute effects on touch
- Bomb: destroys surrounding blocks, one bomb block can contain several
	- Exploding bombs can set off other nearby bombs for maximum destruction
	- Show as a chain of explosions, not all at the same time
- Rainbow block: its color changes repeatedly, touch a color to make all blocks of that color disappear
- HP recovery
- [Tentative] Scan bar reversal

Fever mode
- Fever mode gauge is located below the grid on the UI
- Each successful match adds to the gauge
- [Tentative] Malicious blocks exploding decrease the gauge
- During fever mode, for every match, all blocks directly adjacent to the matched blocks are also collected
- Fever mode lasts a certain amount of time (not specified yet)

Victory conditions
- Quests may have various victory conditions, e.g. (as of now):
	1. Score reaches certain amount
	2. Collected X number of a certain block type
	3. Time trial, managed to get by without dying
- No victory condition in Endless Mode, but difficulty increases with time

Defeat conditions
- Malicious blocks can appear at times
- Each time the scan bar passes on them, a counter is decremented
- When the counter reaches 0, the block explodes like a bomb, dealing damage to the player
- Blocks destroyed are discarded and not collected
- There are two ways to get rid of them (as of now):
	1. Toss them to the bottom of the grid and they will disappear
	2. Destroy them with a bomb nearby
- Game is over when player's HP reaches 0

Game cycle
- Blocks matched during a game are collected and added to player's treasurery
- Those blocks act as in-game currency (similar to Meteos DS)
- In-game currency can purchase new characters, new themes, unlock features
